# rename-multiple-files
This node.js script renames all files in the given directory.

> Note: change the TODO parts according to your needs.

## Disclaimer
1. **It would be best to make a backup of the directory before running the script, just in case :-)**
2. Sure, this could have been done very easily with a shell script, but my main goal was to play around with [node.js' fs module](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html).

## Usage
```
node app.js
```
