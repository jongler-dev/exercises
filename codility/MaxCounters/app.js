/*
You are given N counters, initially set to 0, and you have two possible operations on them:

increase(X) − counter X is increased by 1,
max counter − all counters are set to the maximum value of any counter.
A non-empty array A of M integers is given. This array represents consecutive operations:

if A[K] = X, such that 1 ≤ X ≤ N, then operation K is increase(X),
if A[K] = N + 1 then operation K is max counter.
For example, given integer N = 5 and array A such that:

    A[0] = 3
    A[1] = 4
    A[2] = 4
    A[3] = 6
    A[4] = 1
    A[5] = 4
    A[6] = 4
the values of the counters after each consecutive operation will be:

    (0, 0, 1, 0, 0)
    (0, 0, 1, 1, 0)
    (0, 0, 1, 2, 0)
    (2, 2, 2, 2, 2)
    (3, 2, 2, 2, 2)
    (3, 2, 2, 3, 2)
    (3, 2, 2, 4, 2)
The goal is to calculate the value of every counter after all operations.

Write a function:

function solution(N, A);

that, given an integer N and a non-empty array A consisting of M integers,
returns a sequence of integers representing the values of the counters.

Result array should be returned as an array of integers.

For example, given:

    A[0] = 3
    A[1] = 4
    A[2] = 4
    A[3] = 6
    A[4] = 1
    A[5] = 4
    A[6] = 4
the function should return [3, 2, 2, 4, 2], as explained above.

Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:

N and M are integers within the range [1..100,000];
each element of array A is an integer within the range [1..N + 1].

// naive approach: time complexity = O(N*M)
function solutionA(N, A) {
  const counters = new Array(N).fill(0);

  A.forEach((op) => {
    if (op === N + 1) {
      const maxCounter = counters.reduce((acc, val) => {
        return val > acc ? val : acc;
      }, 0);
      counters.fill(maxCounter);
    } else {
      counters[op - 1]++;
    }
  });
  return counters;
}

// better runtime complexity compared to solutionA,
// as we are saving the max value as we go.
// worse case scenario is O(N*M), when all values in A are N+1,
// hence we have to set all array values.
// but in cases where only numerous values in A are N+1 then we are ok.
function solutionB(N, A) {
  const counters = new Array(N).fill(0);
  let maxCounter = 0;

  A.forEach((op) => {
    if (op === N + 1) {
      counters.fill(maxCounter);
    } else {
      counters[op - 1]++;
      if (counters[op - 1] > maxCounter) {
        maxCounter = counters[op - 1];
      }
    }
  });
  return counters;
}

// even better runtime complexity compared to solutionB.
// we will not perform the max couter operaion in case the previous
// operation was max counter - as the second max counter operation does not alter the counters value.
// same runtime as solutionB in terms of BigO, but slightly better.
function solutionC(N, A) {
  const counters = new Array(N).fill(0);
  let maxCounter = 0;
  let prevOp = 'MAX_COUNTER'; // or 'INCREMENT'

  A.forEach((op) => {
    if (op === N + 1) {
      if (prevOp !== 'MAX_COUNTER') {
        counters.fill(maxCounter);
      }
      prevOp = 'MAX_COUNTER';
    } else {
      counters[op - 1]++;
      prevOp = 'INCREMENT';
      if (counters[op - 1] > maxCounter) {
        maxCounter = counters[op - 1];
      }
    }
  });
  return counters;
